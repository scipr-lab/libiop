/** See Succinct Aurora Definition 6.11 for a more formal definition.
 *  TODO: Sync the above line with paper name, and finalized definition number.
 *  Let H be a subset of our field.
 *  An efficient piecewise polynomial P on H is a pair (S, F),
 *  where S is a partition of H, (S = (S_1, ..., S_n)),
 *  and F is a set of functions (F = (f_1, ..., f_n) âˆˆ Field[X]^n).
 *  This pair has the following property:
 *     - s_i is the unique polynomial of degree less than |S| which is an indicator for S_i in S.
 *       This means for x in S_i, s_i(x) = 1, and for x in S / S_i, s_i(x) = 0.
 *     - s_i can be evaluated in polylog(|S|)
 *     - f_i can be evaluated in polylog(|S|)
 *     - n in polylog(|S|)
 *     - for all x in S_i, F(x) = f_i(x)
 *  Consequently we can evaluate P in polylog time as:
 *      P(x) = sum s_i(x)f_i(x)
 *  The piecewise degree of P is max degree(f_i),
 *  and this is important as any polynomial g can be composed with P as:
 *      g(P(x)) = sum s_i(x) g(f_i(x))
 *  so the total degree is |S| + deg(g) * piecewise degree,
 *  as opposed to |S| * deg(g) if this were normal polynomial composition.
