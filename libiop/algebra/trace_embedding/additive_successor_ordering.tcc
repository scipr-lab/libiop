/** precomputed table of primitive polynomials for F_2^n.
 *  Currently these are the Conway polynomials.
 *  Conway polynomials are overly restrictive,
 *  since the 'compatibility' requirement between the generator and generators of the subfields is not needed here.
 *  However we don't know of any speed difference for the domain sizes of interest
 *  without making custom binary field operations.
 *  Consequently we use the Conway polynomial for now as it is fairly standard.
 *
 *  In the table we store the Conway polynomial evaluated at an irreducible element of the field.
 *  The irreducible element we use is the variable of the primitive polynomial,
 *  which is the multiplicative generator we are concerned with.
 *  These are generated from the following sage script:
 *  for dim in range(2, 41):
        K.<a> = GF(2^dim, name='a', modulus='conway')
        p = K.polynomial()
        # Now we print the modulus for cpp
        # coeff contains the terms starting from the constant term going to the highest degree term
        coeff = p.coefficients(sparse=False)
        coeff = coeff[::-1]
        built_str = ("    [%s] = 0b" % dim) + ''.join([str(x) for x in coeff]) + ","
        print(built_str)
